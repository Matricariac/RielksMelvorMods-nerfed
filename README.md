## This is extremely low effort, but I will try to balance the Construction mod for my own personal enjoyment.

Since Rielk has been on a hiatus from the Construction mod, I decided to make some personal adjustments so the mod doesn't feel like cheating. I love the mod for the cozy vibe of constructing your own house, as it harkens me back to RS2 in 2008, but I can't in good conscience engage with the mod due to its rather extreme bonuses for the time invested.

Therefor; I will be working on adjusting some of the buffs down, and the required resource investment up. One of the things I thought when I first picked the mod up, is that there should be gold costs for *everything*, but *especially* the bank slots.

Again, thematically I love the mod, but the balance just isn't there.

Once Rielk begins working on the mod again, I will discontinue this project. For now, I just wanted to make something that I could enjoy without feeling like I need a shower every time I upgrade the black market.
