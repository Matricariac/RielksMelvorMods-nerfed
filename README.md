My mods for the game Melvor Idle. They can easily be installed by going to their page on mod.io and subscribing, then enabling them in the Mod Manager.

# [Priority Auto Survey](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/priority-auto-survey)

When using the Auto Survey button in Cartography, the closest POI to your current position will be targeted and tiles will be surveyed to reach it as directly as possible before moving to the next one.

By default, this will only prioritise POIs that are within vision range and that have had their hidden requirements met.

Once every valid POI is surveyed, the default Auto Survey behaviour will resume from the original position.

### Options:

Ignore Vision: Turn this on to move directly towards any POI on the map, regardless of whether you can see them or not.

Survey Hidden: Turn this on to prioritise tiles with POIs that are still hidden and haven't had their hidden requirements met.

# [Township Auto Trader](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/township-auto-trader)

Automatically purchases items using the township trader.

Adds several UI elements to the trader screen. Allowing you to turn on automatic trading for each resource individually and select which items to buy for the category.

A limit can be set for each category to save a minimum amount of the resource to continue building the township with.

If multiple items are enabled for one category, then trades are completed for the lowest quantity items first.
