My mods for the game Melvor Idle. They can easily be installed by going to their page on mod.io and subscribing, then enabling them in the Mod Manager.

## [Bee Line Auto Survey](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/bee-line-auto-survey)

When using the Auto Survey button in Cartography, the closest POI to the current position will be targeted and tiles will be surveyed to reach it as directly as possible before moving to the next one.

Once every POI is surveyed, the default Auto Survey behaviour will resume.
