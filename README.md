My mods for the game Melvor Idle. They can easily be installed by going to their page on mod.io and subscribing, then enabling them in the Mod Manager.

# [Priority Auto Survey](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/priority-auto-survey)

When using the Auto Survey button in Cartography, the closest POI to your current position will be targeted and tiles will be surveyed to reach it as directly as possible before moving to the next one.

By default, this will only prioritise POIs that are within vision range and that have had their hidden requirements met.

Once every valid POI is surveyed, the default Auto Survey behaviour will resume from the original position.

### Options:

Ignore Vision: Turn this on to move directly towards any POI on the map, regardless of whether you can see them or not.

Survey Hidden: Turn this on to prioritise tiles with POIs that are still hidden and haven't had their hidden requirements met.

# [Township Auto Trader](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/township-auto-trader)

Automatically purchases items using the township trader.

Adds several UI elements to the trader screen. Allowing you to turn on automatic trading for each resource individually and select which items to buy for the category.

A limit can be set for each category to save a minimum amount of the resource to continue building the township with.

If multiple items are enabled for one category, then trade behaviour can be configured to buy the lowest quantity items first, buy an equal number off all selected items, or spend an equal number of resources on each item.

### Options:

Include Upgrades in Count: Include upgrades of items when calculating current quantities of items.

Include Equipped in Count: Include equipped items when calculating current quantities of items.

# [Rune Costs Can Be Zero](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/rune-costs-can-be-zero)

Undo the fix made with 1.3 and remove the cap on rune cost reduction, allowing spell rune costs to be reduced to 0.

(Note, the staff descriptions have not been changed, I doubt I will do that in the future).

As of 1.3, rune cost reduction can't make a spell cost 0 for any rune.

For example, Wind Strike normally costs: 1 Mind Rune and 2 Air Runes.

When equipped with a Staff of Air, this is reduced to: 1 Mind Rune and 1 Air Rune.

This mod undoes the 1.3 change and allows the full reduction to: 1 Mind Rune (and 0 Air Runes).

 

There is the option to turn the mod off in the mod's settings. It starts on by default.

# [Remove Consumptions](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/remove-consumptions)
Removes the consumptions of various items in the game. Each type of item can be turned on individually in the mod's settings.

Note: You still need to obtain and/or equip the item in order to use it. This will only provide 100% preservation and stop them being removed.

Note 2: Only potion charges are preserved. So, 1 potion will be used when a potion is selected.

### Options:

Remove Ammunition Consumption: Stops ammo being consumed.

Remove Rune Consumption: Stops runes being consumed.

Remove Prayer Point Consumption: Stops prayer points (and soul points if you have ItA) being consumed.

Remove Food Consumption: Stops food being consumed.

Remove Summoning Tablet Consumption: Stops summoning tablets being consumed.

Remove Consumable Consumption: Stops items in the consumable slot being consumed.

Remove Potion Consumption: Stops potion charges being consumed. (Note: This will still use 1 potion when it is first selected.)

# [Reset Temporary Cartography Boosts](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/reset-temporary-cartography-boosts)

Adds a button in the mod's options which resets the points of interest with temporary survey interval bonuses so they can be reused.

I realised that I wasted the boosts early on while I was still learning the game, and now that I'm trying to complete the map, I wish I still had the boosts available. Now I do :)

# [Remove Ammo Consumption](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/remove-ammo-consumption)

Note: Ammunition must still be equipped, it will just not be used up.
